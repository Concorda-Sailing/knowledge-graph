# knowledge-graph

A small, project-agnostic substrate that gives an AI coding collaborator working memory about a codebase. Three pieces:

| Tool | What it does | Repo |
|---|---|---|
| **depgraph** | Code-structure nodes (models, services, endpoints, components, hooks, tests) + reverse-dependency index. Hooks into Claude Code's PreToolUse to inject dependents before every edit. | [`depgraph`](https://github.com/Concorda-Sailing/depgraph) |
| **logigraph** | Authored business rules, domain entities, and process flows. Hooks inject applicable rule prose + flow context on edit. Mediation-collision detection flags design defects. | [`logigraph`](https://github.com/Concorda-Sailing/logigraph) |
| **graphui** | FastAPI + Jinja2 dark-themed viewer for both graphs. Coverage gallery, repo-and-kind navigation, mobile-friendly cards, Needs-attention card, review queue with promote-from-draft. | [`graphui`](https://github.com/Concorda-Sailing/graphui) |

Framework code lives in `~/tools/{depgraph,logigraph,graphui}/`. Per-project data lives in `<project>/depgraph/` and `<project>/logigraph/` — nodes, dossiers, extractors, telemetry, plus a `project.toml` declaring the project's tracked repos.

---

## For humans: install with Claude Code

Open Claude Code in any directory and ask. Claude reads this README and runs the steps.

> **"Install knowledge-graph for this codebase."**

Claude clones the framework to `~/tools/`, scaffolds your project's data dirs, wires the Claude Code hooks, starts the graphui daemon, and verifies all three. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

Other useful asks (Claude follows the runbook in the next section):

> **"Add a new tracked repo to the graph."**
>
> **"Author a rule for `<short description>`."**
>
> **"Show me what's pending review on the graph."**
>
> **"Why is `<flag>` showing on the dashboard?"**
>
> **"Open graphui."** (Claude tells you the URL — typically `http://localhost:8081/graph/` or the LAN equivalent.)

Optional ergonomics:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/tools/depgraph/bin:$HOME/tools/logigraph/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
# now `depgraph regen` / `logigraph validate` work from any cwd
```

## For Claude: runbook

This section is the source of truth for what to do when a user asks for knowledge-graph operations. Read carefully before acting.

```

### When the user asks: "Install knowledge-graph"

1. If `~/tools/knowledge-graph/` doesn't exist, clone it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Concorda-Sailing/knowledge-graph.git ~/tools/knowledge-graph
   ```
2. Resolve the project path. If the user is `cd`'d into the project, use `$PWD`. Otherwise ask which project root to wire up.
3. Run the bootstrap:
   ```bash
   ~/tools/knowledge-graph/install.sh bootstrap <project_path>
   ```
   This clones `depgraph`, `logigraph`, `graphui` into `~/tools/`, scaffolds `<project_path>/depgraph/` and `<project_path>/logigraph/`, writes `~/.claude/settings.json` hook entries (with `DEPGRAPH_DATA_DIR` and `LOGIGRAPH_DATA_DIR` set explicitly to the project paths), and registers the graphui systemd `--user` service.
4. Verify; all three should pass:
   ```bash
   DEPGRAPH_DATA_DIR=<project_path>/depgraph ~/tools/depgraph/bin/depgraph self-check
   DEPGRAPH_DATA_DIR=<project_path>/depgraph ~/tools/depgraph/bin/depgraph validate
   LOGIGRAPH_DATA_DIR=<project_path>/logigraph DEPGRAPH_DATA_DIR=<project_path>/depgraph ~/tools/logigraph/bin/logigraph validate
   systemctl --user is-active graphui
   ```
5. Tell the user the graphui URL: `http://localhost:8081/graph/` (or LAN IP).

### When the user asks: "Add a new tracked repo"

1. Read the current `<project>/depgraph/project.toml`.
2. Add a new `[repos.<key>]` table with required `path` and an `extractor` array — e.g. `["python3", "{data_dir}/extractors/extract_<key>.py"]`. Set `files_arg = "--only"` if the extractor takes `--only <file>` flags per touched file; omit otherwise.
3. Author the extractor file in `<project>/depgraph/extractors/`. Copy structure from an existing extractor in the same data dir if one exists.
4. Run `bin/depgraph regen` and confirm nodes appear under `<project>/depgraph/nodes/`.
5. If logigraph rules will claim against the new repo, also add the `[repos.<key>]` table to `<project>/logigraph/project.toml` so path-classification works for the logigraph hook.

### When the user asks: "Author a rule / process / domain entity"

1. Read the relevant schema first: `~/tools/logigraph/schema/{rule,process,domain}.schema.json`. Each defines required fields and `$defs.warning`.
2. Use the naming convention: `<kind>::<category>::<short_name>` (lowercase, underscores). The filename mirrors the id with `::` → `__`.
3. Required fields by kind:
   - **Rule**: `statement` (one-sentence), `claims_code` (≥1; each pinned via `depgraph_id` + `remote_hash`), `references_domain` (≥1).
   - **Process**: `flow` (object: `action` required; `ui_surface`, `endpoint` optional), `steps` (≥1; each with `claims_code`, optional `transitions: [{to, when}]`).
   - **Domain**: `subkind` (role/resource/attribute/relationship/action), `summary`. Relationships need `from`, `to`, `predicate`, `mediated_by`, `cardinality`, `lifecycle`.
4. Set `definition_status: "llm_drafted"` initially. Compute `structural_hash` as `sha256(<id>).hexdigest()` for new nodes.
5. Author the dossier file in the matching `dossiers/<kind>/` subdir. Rule dossiers MUST contain sections `## The rule`, `## Why it exists`, `## Decision table`. Domain (role subkind) dossiers have their own required sections per `bin/logigraph validate`. Process dossiers have no required sections (pointer semantics).
6. Run `bin/logigraph validate` — fix any errors before declaring done.
7. Run `bin/logigraph regen` — confirm 0 orphans, 0 stale, no new collisions.
8. Tell the user the draft is in the review queue at `http://<host>:8081/graph/review` so they can promote via the UI's bump button.

### When the user asks: "What's pending review?"

1. `http://localhost:8081/graph/review` is the canonical list.
2. CLI alternative: `bin/logigraph stats` shows the per-kind `llm_drafted` count.
3. The index page's "Needs attention" card also surfaces `unreviewed_dossier` flags (one per `llm_drafted` node) plus any reconcile-detected drift/orphans.

### When the user asks: "Why is `<flag>` showing on the dashboard?"

1. Flags live in `<project>/logigraph/nodes/_meta.json::flags` — read it directly or via graphui's index page.
2. Each flag has `kind` (defect/drift/gap/review_due/incident), `severity`, `message`, `tracked` boolean, optional `tracking_ref`, and an `affected` list of node ids.
3. **Fresh** (`tracked: false`) = triage. Either resolve in code (delete the source of the drift) or formalize via the warning shape on the affected node (set `tracked: true` + add `tracking_ref`).
4. **Tracked** (`tracked: true`) = acknowledged but live. Don't re-flag; reference the existing `tracking_ref` if proposing to actually fix.
5. Auto-derived warnings (`discovered_by: "reconcile"`) come from `extractors/reconcile.py::build_flags` — codes include `mediation_collision`, `stale_claim`, `orphan_claim`, `orphan_domain_ref`, `unreviewed_dossier`, `stub_dossier`.

### Conventions Claude must follow (framework-level rules)

- **No hardcoded project strings outside `project.toml`.** Path resolution goes through `lib/config` helpers (`path_to_repo_relative`, `project_repos`, `basename_path_map`, `repo_for_basename`, `primary_repo_path`). Never `Path.home() / "<literal-basename>"`. Never `seg.startswith("<literal-prefix>")` as a tracked-repo check.
- **Warnings use the universal shape.** Required fields: `code`, `kind`, `severity`, `message`, `tracked`, `discovered_at`, `discovered_by`. Defined as `$defs.warning` in each schema. New node kinds copy it verbatim.
- **Schemas live with the tool, not with the data.** `~/tools/<framework>/schema/`, never `<project>/<framework>/schema/`.
- **Bumping `definition_status` to `human_reviewed` is the *user's* call, not Claude's.** Author drafts; surface them via the review queue; let the human click Promote in graphui.
- **Commit trailers**: every commit in a tracked repo should end with `bin/depgraph commit-summary` output. Greppable via `git log --grep="Depgraph:"`.

### Hook environment

Each entry in `~/.claude/settings.json` prefixes its command with the env vars:

```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [{
    "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit",
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "DEPGRAPH_DATA_DIR=/path/to/<project>/depgraph python3 ~/tools/depgraph/hooks/pre_edit_inject.py",
      "timeout": 5
    }, {
      "type": "command",
      "command": "LOGIGRAPH_DATA_DIR=/path/to/<project>/logigraph DEPGRAPH_DATA_DIR=/path/to/<project>/depgraph python3 ~/tools/logigraph/hooks/pre_edit_inject.py",
      "timeout": 5
    }]
  }],
  "Stop": [{
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "DEPGRAPH_DATA_DIR=/path/to/<project>/depgraph python3 ~/tools/depgraph/hooks/post_edit_regen.py",
      "timeout": 60
    }]
  }]
}
```

For multi-project setups (the framework dogfooding itself, or two projects on one machine), add a second set of hook entries with different `*_DATA_DIR` values. Each hook script's `path_to_repo_relative` returns `None` for paths outside its own `[repos.*]`, so non-matching hooks silently no-op.

### Regen lifecycle

```
source change
   ↓
Stop hook on touched file (or `bin/depgraph regen`)
   ↓
mark _meta.regen_status: in_progress
   ↓
extractors emit per-node JSON (deterministic, no LLM)
   ↓
reconcile.py
   ├─ rebuild reverse-edge index (depgraph) / by_code, by_file, by_domain (logigraph)
   ├─ refresh remote_hash on every claim from depgraph corpus; mark stale on drift
   ├─ detect orphans (file deleted) and orphan domain refs (rule references unauthored entity)
   ├─ detect mediation collisions (relationships sharing storage)
   ├─ write _meta.json with regen_status: complete + flags array
   ↓
PreToolUse on Edit
   ↓
hook reads nodes + flags; injects applicable dossier + dependents + warnings
```

If a regen crashes mid-flight, `_meta.regen_status` stays `in_progress` and the next hook surfaces a torn-graph banner. Re-run `bin/depgraph regen` (and `bin/logigraph regen`) to recover.

### Framework self-tracking (advanced)

The framework can track itself: `~/knowledge-graph-meta/` is a data dir whose `project.toml` lists `~/tools/depgraph`, `~/tools/logigraph`, `~/tools/graphui` as tracked repos. Authored rules (`rule::config::no_hardcoded_project_strings`, `rule::warnings::use_universal_object_shape`) fire on framework edits, so when extending the framework Claude sees its own invariants. Not required for normal project use; a useful dogfood when contributing to the framework itself.
